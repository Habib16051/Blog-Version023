# Blog-Version023

# Overview
Implemented a tagging system by integrating a third-party application(taggit) with this
project.Generated post recommendations using complex QuerySets.Also learned how to
create custom Django template tags and filters to provide templates with custom functionalities.Created a sitemap for search engines to crawl your site and an RSS feed for users to subscribe to
your blog.Then built a search engine for my blog using the full-text search engine of PostgreSQL.
